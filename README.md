# Pipeline reconstruction

A repository aiming to reproduce the result in [Unsupervised Disentanglement of Pose, Appearance and Background from Images and Videos](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ryen_CEFwr)

The code is now under testing i.e. buggy, ugly, not working yet.
Feel free to review the code. Any suggestion for [ChinYing-Li](https://github.com/ChinYing-Li) would be appreciated.

###### The code borrowed heavily from...
* [pytorch-UNet](https://github.com/cosmic-cortex/pytorch-UNet)
* [Fast Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style)
* [SPADE](https://github.com/NVlabs/SPADE)
